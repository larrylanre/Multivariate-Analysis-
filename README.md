Tittle of Project: Application of Multivariate analysis in Oil and Gas data

This second part of the project will narrow down the analysis at well level. We will select the lowest wells based on number of stage ranking and will apply different classification methodology in other to predict the performance of the wells. Ranking the well was carried out using KNN and the main predictor in this model is the volume of Proppant pumped. 

This project will be presented by creating machine learning algorithm and visualization in R and Spotfire. The machine learning method that will be applied in this project will be Neural Network and Multivariate(Regression) Analysis.
The subset dataset in this analysis contains over 26,000 observations of daily oil and gas production volume with about 23 possible variables to analyze. The first part of this project uses number of stages as the main predictor, but we will be using the volume of proppant pumped as the main predictor to determine the impact on production. 

A question to solve is to confirm if increasing or decreasing the volume of proppant will have any positive or negative impact on the production volume.
